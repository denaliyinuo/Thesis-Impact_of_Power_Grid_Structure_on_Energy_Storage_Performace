# Thesis - Impact of Power Grid Structure on Energy Storage Performance

# Overview

The purpose of this report was to quantify the impact of the electrical grid's structure (ex. impedance, capacitance, connections) on 
energy storage (ES), and to determine the optimal location for ES.  The results showed that centrally located ES devices with several 
connections to other nodes, as well as increased number of connections (transmission lines) in the grid improved ES performance.  
The included Matlab files will quantify each node's performance and rank each node, thus determining the optimum location for ES.

# ES Efficiency vs Node Location

In this paper, ES net ability is a measure of ES efficiency.  Node location is a unitless quantity that quantifies a nodes location relative to the other nodes in the grid.  The graphs below show the results for three different grids, IEEE 30, 118, and 300, and the results show a strong relationship between a node's location and how well ES performs at said node.  This means that it is advantageous to place ES in a central location in the grid.

# ES Efficiency vs Number of Connections

ES efficiency was compared to the number of connections to each node in a grid, and the results show a strong relationship between number of connections and ES efficiency.  The results in the two sets of charts shows that is it optimal to place ES in a centrally located node, and to ensure that said node has several connections.

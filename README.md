# Thesis - Impact of Power Grid Structure on Energy Storage Performace

# Overview

The purpose of this report was to quantify the impact of the electrical grid's structure (ex. impedance, capacitance, connections) on 
energy storage (ES), and to determine the optimal location for ES.  The resutls showed that centrally located ES devices with several 
connections to other nodes, as well as increased number of connections (transmission lines) in the grid improved ES performance.  
The included Matlab files will quantify each node's performance and rank each node, thus determining the optimum location for ES.
